        <p>This is my first site, which was created ten days after the start of training. The creation of the site took five days - from the idea to the finished result. The site was created without the use of JavaScript, so the function of changing the language and color theme is made by links. Only knowledge of HTML and CSS (SASS) was used. Grid, Flex and JavaScript have not yet been explored.For work, we used the VisualStudioCode editor with the installed extensions Live Saas Compiler, Live Server, eCSStractor.</p>

        <h2>Greetings! I am Dmitry. <br>
            A few words about me.</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Education. </em> <br>Born in Ukraine in the city of Kharkov. He graduated from high school in the same city. He studied at the National Aerospace University (KhAI) with a degree in: "Radio engineering devices, systems and complexes." In 2002 he defended his diploma for a Bachelor's degree, and in 2003 for a Specialist's degree (Theme of work: "Development of voice signal compression algorithms in DECT and GSM900/1800 mobile communication systems"). In 2006 he graduated from the courses of managers.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            <em>Profession. </em><br>For the last twenty years, my main activity has been everything related to engineering. He went all the way from an employee to the chief engineer of the enterprise. This path took 12 years in peacetime. Worked both in the staff of companies and as a freelancer. The main direction is automated process control systems in food production and public catering establishments. Performed a full cycle of work on the development, creation and maintenance of power supply, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration systems for facilities. A full stack of work: customer search, statement of technical specifications, selection of equipment, development of an electrical circuit and documentation, assembly and installation (installation supervision) of equipment, warranty and service maintenance, modernization of outdated systems. As a freelance consultant for engineering communications, in addition to the main ones, he solved issues of water supply, sanitation and other related tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Hobby.</em><br>I like to learn and apply new technologies in practice in my work. In addition, I like to create something new, something that is not there yet. Therefore, all my hobbies in one way or another arose out of ordinary curiosity. For example, flocking, phosphors, heat accumulator. I study technologies in detail and mix (combine) them. As a result, a unique product or a new direction for development appears. For example, the results of the hobby were: collections of leather goods of our own design, using modern technologies in 2011 and 2020; from idea to packaging, a decor series using phosphors in 2015; a patent for a utility model of a heat accumulator and a working prototype in 2021. 
        </p>  
        <p>
            <em>Computer programs. </em><br>Since 2002, in my professional activity and hobby, I have been using various tools. To create a design for printing and packaging - CorelDraw and Photoshop; for industrial design and prototyping Blender, ArtCam, Candy sometimes Pepakura; for writing books and articles - text editors. <q>Any real education is obtained only through self-education.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Programming. </em><br>Since 2018 my interest has been towards programming languages. This is a very interesting industry where you can create new, bright, out of the ordinary products without the need for large investments in complex machines and real estate. Using a personal laptop, you can create useful utilities and beautiful websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Self-education. </em><br>Access to video courses and books on the Internet allows you to build knowledge on your own. I tried my hand in several directions: <br>
        <ul class="list"> 
            <li>Copywriting.</li>
            <li>Design.</li>
            <li>3D modeling.</li>
            <li>Back-end with Python.</li>
            <li>Front-end.</li>
        </ul>
            Of all the directions, it is the Front-end that interests me the most. Development of the visible part of the site, combines both programming and design. I already know how to do this using HTML and CSS and SCSS / SASS. My works created in this direction are presented in the portfolio. The next step is learning JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS and NodeJS. This page was created in a few days, after the first month of training. <q> Thinking right is more valuable than knowing a lot. — John Locke.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>My goal.</em> My goal is to turn the hobby of creating websites into a profession, the income from which will allow the whole family to travel. Over the past twenty years, I have managed to make a full-fledged professional career in an industry that requires a high level of responsibility, composure and knowledge. In the next ten years, I want to take a new path - in the industry of creating websites and online applications. <q>Work until you get results. No matter how long it takes - Henry Ford.</q>
